One operating system function is managing devices. Managed devices include things like keyboards, monitors, speakers, hard drives, and mostly all peripherals. The operating system keeps track of what is plugged into the computer and decides what processes get the device.
Another operating system function is file management. The operating system specifies the permissions for a file such as read and write. It also specifies the type, size, location, etc. on the computer for the user.
Finally, another operating system function is performance monitoring. The operating system monitors and reports allocated system and hardware resources in the computer, allows you to start and stop services, and stop processes.
